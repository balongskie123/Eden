steps:
  # Step 1: Checks out your repository code under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
  - name: Checkout Repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  # Step 2: Install C++ compiler, CMake, and build tools
  - name: Install Dependencies (g++, make, cmake)
    run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake

  # Step 3: Configure the build using CMake
  # Creates a dedicated 'build' directory and runs cmake to set up the build files
  - name: Configure CMake
    run: |
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..

  # Step 4: Executes the build script (compiles the C++ source code)
  # --parallel flag uses all available cores for a faster build
  - name: Build Project
    run: cmake --build build --parallel

  # Step 5: Runs C++ tests (assuming tests are configured via CTest in CMake)
  - name: Run Tests
    # Runs 'ctest' command from the build directory
    run: cd build && ctest

  # Step 6: Uploads the built output (artifact) for later use
  - name: Upload Build Artifact
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: cpp-executable-artifact
      # Replace 'build/MyApp' with the actual path to your compiled executable or library
      path: build/MyApp
